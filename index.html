      <h1>What this does?</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This tool enables you to generate prompts for every verse in the Bible, utilizing the King James Bible as a reference. For instance, entering a prompt like "Explain [verse]" will produce
          outputs such as "Explain Genesis 1:1", "Explain Genesis 1:2" etc... Keep in mind that while it primarily uses the KJV for Book/Chapter/Verse references, you can easily modify the prompt to
          fit the translation of your choice, such as "Explain [verse] from the NIV Bible".
        </li>
        <li>
          The generated output is saved as an Excel file (.xlsx). This design choice allows for the use of Excel's hyperlink function, making it simple to create clickable links for each verse that
          correspond to the AI's responses. Note: While the prompts generated can be used for any translation as explained in the previous point, the verses outputted in the excel file will be KJV.
          However these are 2 separate features (prompt generation and hyperlinking verses), and can be used independently from one another.

          The overall process is straightforward:
          <ul>
            <li>Generate prompts for every verse in the Bible.</li>
            <li>Copy the prompt for the verse you wish to inquire about from the Excel file and input it into the AI.</li>
            <li>After receiving the AI's response, copy the shareable URL and paste it into the corresponding URL cell in the Excel file next to the verse you queried.</li>
            <li>This allows you to easily share a clickable Bible verse which is hyperlinked to the AI's response to that verse.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
